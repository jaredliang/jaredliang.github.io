`News Summary`

* The euro has pushed above the 1.15 line and is trading at its highest levels since May 2016. The currency received a boost on Tuesday, following the news that the Republicans will not attempt to advance their health care proposal before Congress takes a recess in August. This decision is a major setback to President Trump, who has tried to pass a health care bill which would replace Obamacare, but opposition from some Republican lawmakers has meant that the White House does not have the votes to pass such a bill.
* "ECB continues moving closer to eventual policy normalisation". By normalisation it is meant a reduction in quantitative easing - or asset purchases in ECB-speak.

`News Summary`

* US GDP growth revised up to 1.4% in Q2

 * EUR will be the diminishing prospects for aggressive ECB easing from here. In particular, the Governing Council will have to deal with issues like asset scarcity and the flatness of the EGB curve. We expect the ECB to announce more measures that will allow it to lengthen the duration of its programme this December.
 * We doubt that it will be able to continue buying EGBs at current pace beyond 2017, however. As a result market expectations of a QE taper could intensify next year. All this will likely make EUR a less attractive funding currency and should help lift the long end of the EGB curve relative to the rest of G10.

 * "The three elements of successful trading are: Cutting losses, cutting losses,
 cutting losses. If you can follow these rules, you may have a chance!"
 * Pay-off ratio: average winning trade / average losing trade. Greater than 1 and you are
making more when you win, than you lose when you lose; less than 1
and your losses are greater than your wins.
 * “Always have a two-way exit strategy; know when you plan to cut your
profits, as well as when to cut your losses. These can be revised frequently,
but always refer back to the initial plan to keep that sense of perspective.”
 * Trading is simple, not easy.
 * The research done in behavioural finance suggests that the majority of people
in a situation of gain will become risk averse (take less risk); whilst in a
situation of loss they are more likely to become risk-taking. In trading terms,
the majority of people when in a winning position are likely to cut the winner,
whilst in a situation of loss they are likely to run the loss.
 * When you take excessive risk in relation to your trading account, you are creating a higher level of mental engagement and stress, which impacts upon your decisionmaking.
