# How Rich People Think #

 * This book compares the thoughts and habits of the middle class to the wealthiest individuals. (Steve Siebold)
 * "I later discovered after hundreds of interviews that it wasn't the lack of desire that held the masses back from getting wealthy, but the lack of belief in their own ability to make it happen."
 * The masses think the road to riches starts with formal education, the rich, on the other hand, believe in acquiring specific knowledge.
 * plenty of successful people have a master's degree or doctorate  but it's not a prerequisite for getting rich. Solve the problem, get compensated, and repeat the process until you're rich. End of story."
 * the rich value hard work, they know that at the end of the day, leverage creates wealth. "If hard work was the secret to financial success, every construction worker and cocktail waitress would be rich,"
 * Hard work to the wealthy means out thinking their competitors and leveraging the collective brainpower of their advisors.
 * The masses think you have to have money in the first place to get rich. "The truth is you have to have great ideas that solve problems to make money,
 * Rich people believe in using other people's money to finance a great idea.
 * "The masses' major goal with money is to retire at 65 and hopefully have enough money to survive until they die," Siebold explains. "The world class, while often no more ambitious, set their sights on impacting the world with their wealth."
 * "Working for the sole purpose of making money is the worst strategy for building wealth," Siebold says.
 * "Instead of setting out to find work with the most profit potential, focus on work that has the most fulfillment potential. Once you find it, invest so much heart and soul into your work that you become one of the most competent people in your field. You'll be rewarded with uncommon wealth."
 * "Middle class believes they must choose between a great family life and being rich," Siebold writes. "World class knows you can have it all."
